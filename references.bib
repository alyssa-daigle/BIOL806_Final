	abstract = {Duckweeds include the world's smallest and fastest growing flowering plants that have the capacity to produce huge biomass with a broad range of potential applications like production of feed and food, biofuel and biogas. In order to achieve optimal and sustainable commercial system, it is necessary that suitable species and clones of duckweeds be identified and selected based on appropriate strategies. However, a high degree of reduction in their structural complexity poses serious problems in identification of closely related species of duckweeds, on a morphological basis. Use of molecular taxonomic tools is the present solution. The state of the art of molecular taxonomy of all the five genera of duckweeds (Spirodela, Landoltia, Lemna, Wolffiella, and Wolffia) is based mainly on the techniques of fingerprinting by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and barcoding using sequences of plastidic DNA fragments. After more than 15 years of molecular taxonomic investigations, a certain viewpoint is now available demonstrating all five genera to be monophyletic. Also, the phenetic analyses had made huge progress in delineating the currently defined 36 species of duckweeds, although, all species cannot yet be defined with confidence. Wolffiella has turned out to be the most complicated genus as only 6 to 7 species out of the 10 can be reliably delineated. Further progress in the phylogenetic and phenetic analyses requires more advanced methods like next generation and/or whole genome sequencing. First results using the method genotyping-by-sequencing in the genus Lemna (in combination with metabolomic profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) as well as AFLP and barcoding by plastidic sequences) are more promising: The species Lemna valdiviana and Lemna yungensis were united to one species, Lemna valdiviana. This reduced the total number of Lemnaceae species to 36.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication is a major cause of water quality loss. It is characterized by an enrichment in the concentration of inorganic nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) in water bodies. A promising way to mitigate eutrophication is the development of phytoremediation processes in which aquatic plants are used to assimilate nutrients from water bodies. Pontederia crassipes, also known as water hyacinth, is adapted to eutrophic environments and its high growth rate favors phytoremediation. Although this species has been widely studied for phytoremediation, few studies consider the role of the associated microbial community in this process. Our objective was to evaluate removal of nitrogen and phosphorus by P. crassipes and investigate the bacterial community associated with its roots comparing two seasons in a tropical reservoir in Brazil. A system was developed, consisting of five mesocosms of 3000 L each that simulated flow of water from input of nutrients to output of the reservoir. Each mesocosm started with 30 live plants to simulate natural mats of P crassipes. Physicochemical parameters, vegetation cover, and nutrient concentrations of the mesocosms were evaluated weekly. At the initiation and termination of the experiment (4 weeks), P and N concentrations in plant tissues were analyzed along with biomass measurements. The root associated bacterial community was analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. We observed that the phytoremediation process was slower in the winter than in the summer. We relate this effect to the water temperature, which decreased by an average of 7 °C. Significant differences were identified in specific bacterial orders in root-associated communities, with Chroococcales being the most abundant in the summer and Bacillales in the winter. Thus, P. crassipes can act effectively for phytoremediation throughout the year, but in colder periods, it is necessary to increase the number of plants because their growth rate is compromised. Changes in the associated bacterial community can be related to the seasonal variation in phytoremediation efficiency.},

	abstract = {The linkage between tree diversity and the soil food web in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems remains uncertain. Using microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), we analyzed the effect of tree species composition on microbial communities from topsoil collected in Hainich National Park, Germany. Previous results had shown minimal direct effects of tree species on the microbial community in autumn, most likely due to low plant activity and high nutrient and energy input from litterfall. However, microbial composition was affected indirectly through an influence of tree species on soil pH. In this study, we analyzed PLFA profiles in early summer and compared them with the results from autumn sampling. We hypothesized that plant-based traits would have stronger direct effects on the abundance and structure of the microbial community during the photosynthetically active period. The results showed that the soil microbial community differed more markedly between the tree diversity levels in early summer than in autumn. The acidifying character of the decaying beech litter strongly influenced the soil pH values and structured the soil microbial community indirectly in early summer as it had in autumn. However, the measured differences in the microbial composition in early summer could be attributed primarily to litter quality. This direct influence of plant traits appeared to be eclipsed in autumn because of the high nutrient supply from fresh litter input. Following litter decomposition in the topsoil, however, litter-based plant traits emerged as a factor structuring the soil microbial community in early summer. Our results suggest that the PLFAs i14:0 and i15:0, indicative of Gram-positive bacteria, are strongly involved in decomposition processes and may be promoted by readily available nutrients. Furthermore, our results indicate that a dense root network in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi strongly supported microbial growth in the more diverse forest stands. High proportions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (PLFA 16:1ω5), root-associated microorganisms (PLFAs 16:1ω9, 16:1ω7, 17:1ω8 and 18:1ω7) and bacterial grazers (PLFA 20:5) characterized the microbial community in early summer on these study plots. We conclude that microbial communities are strongly influenced by abiotic controls. However, seasonal differences in litter decomposition rates and root activity should be considered in the analysis of the effects of tree diversity or species on soil microbial communities.},

	abstract = {There has been much interest recently in the use of constructed wetlands for the removal of toxic trace elements from wastewaters. Wetland plants play an important role in the trace elements removal process. It is not known, however, which wetland plant species absorb specific trace elements at the fastest rates. Such knowledge is essential to maximize the efficiency of trace element removal by wetlands. In this study, we investigated the potential of duckweed (Lemna minor L.) to accumulate Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Se when supplied individually in a nutrient solution at a series of concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 10 mg L−1. The results show that under experimental conditions, duckweed proved to be a good accumulator of Cd, Se, and Cu, a moderate accumulator of Cr, and a poor accumulator of Ni and Pb. The highest concentrations of each trace element accumulated in duckweed tissues were 13.3 g Cd kg−1, 4.27 g Se kg−1, 3.36 g Cu kg−1, 2.87 g Cr kg−1, 1.79 g Ni kg−1, and 0.63 g Pb kg−1. Duckweed exhibited some symptoms of toxicity (e.g., reduced growth, chlorosis) at higher levels of element supply (except for Cr). The toxicity effect of each trace element on plant growth was, in descending order of damage, Cu {\textbackslash}textgreater Se {\textbackslash}textgreater Pb {\textbackslash}textgreater Cd {\textbackslash}textgreater Ni {\textbackslash}textgreater Cr. We conclude that duckweed shows promise for the removal of Cd, Se, and Cu from contaminated wastewater since it accumulates high concentrations of these elements. Further, the growth rates and harvest potential make duckweed a good species for phytoremediation activities.},

	abstract = {Ecological floating beds could enable roots to become suspended and this allowed submerged roots to harbour various types of microbes. But, there was a lack of systematic research on microbial community structure changes and the influencing mechanisms. In this study, the ecological floating beds were constructed using selected plants [Cyperus involucratus Rottboll (Cyp), Thalia dealbata Fraser (Tha) and Iris tectorum Maxim (Iri)] that was compared with a control group [static water (S)]. The results showed that the highest abundance and diversity of root microbial communities were found in autumn, with the dominant taxa being Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Acidobacteriota. The microbial communities of Tha and Cyp groups greatly overlapped, while the Iri and control groups exhibited distinctly diverse communities. The root microbial populations of the same plant also reflected a large change in different seasons. Conversely, photosynthetic autotrophs and specialized anaerobes were more inclined to thrive at higher temperatures and lower DO concentrations and then they gradually became the dominant species. Microbial co-occurrences of the Tha and control groups were complex and showed both cooperation and competition. In addition, TOC was an important environmental factor that shaped the microbial community structures and DO changed the microbial community by affecting the abundance of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Microorganisms showed potential for degradation and metabolism of non-food substances with low/no corresponding metabolic pathways.},

	abstract = {Duckweed is a promising feedstock for the production of biofuels. Advantageous characteristics include rapid, clonal growth as small free-floating plants on nutrient-rich water; global adaptability across a broad range of climates; naturally high protein content; and inducible high starch content with low or no lignin, which enables other value-added products. The objective of this article is to review the published research on duckweed cultivation in nutrient-rich wastewaters, starch enrichment in duckweed plants and conversion of high-starch duckweed to biofuels. Duckweed yields of 39.1–105.9 t ha-1 year-1 have been achieved using wastewater as the nutrient source, which are much higher than the yields of most other potential energy crops. Duckweed starch contents of 31.0–45.8\% dry weight have been achieved after it has been subjected to nutrient starvation for 5–10 days, and up to 94.7\% of the starch could be converted to ethanol using the existing technologies for corn starch conversion. Future research objectives include selecting high-performance duckweed strains, improving starch enrichment and conversion, and developing technologies for large-scale operations.},

	abstract = {Lemnaceae or duckweed is an aquatic plant that can be used to recover nutrients from wastewaters. The grown duckweed can be a good resource of proteins and starch, and utilized for the production of value-added products such as animal feed and fuel ethanol. In the last eleven years we have been working on growing duckweed on anaerobically treated swine wastewater and utilizing the duckweed for fuel ethanol production. Duckweed strains that grew well on the swine wastewater were screened in laboratory and greenhouse experiments. The selected duckweed strains were then tested for nutrient recovery under laboratory and field conditions. The rates of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by the duckweed growing in the laboratory and field systems were determined in the study. The mechanisms of nutrient uptake by the duckweed and the growth of duckweed in a nutrient-limited environment have been studied. When there are nutrients (N and P) available in the wastewater, duckweed takes the nutrients from the wastewater to support its growth and to store the nutrients in its tissue. When the N and P are completely removed from the wastewater, duckweed can use its internally stored nutrients to keep its growth for a significant period of time. A modified Monod model has been developed to describe nitrogen transport in a duckweed-covered pond for nutrient recovery from anaerobically treated swine wastewater. Nutrient reserve in the duckweed biomass has been found the key to the kinetics of duckweed growth. Utilization of duckweed for value-added products has a good potential. Using duckweed to feed animals, poultry, and fish has been extensively studied with promising results. Duckweed is also an alternative starch source for fuel ethanol production. Spirodela polyrrhiza grown on anaerobically treated swine wastewater was found to have a starch content of 45.8\% (dry weight). Enzymatic hydrolysis of the duckweed biomass with amylases yielded a hydrolysate with a reducing sugar content corresponding to 50.9\% of the original dry duckweed biomass. Fermentation of the hydrolysate using yeast gave an ethanol yield of 25.8\% of the original dry duckweed biomass. These results indicate that the duckweed biomass can produce significant quantities of starch that can be readily converted into ethanol.},
